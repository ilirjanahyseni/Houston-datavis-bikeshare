## A Brief Project Description

Houston BCycle is a non-profit organization that operates a bicycle-sharing system for the City of Houston. With over 150 stations and 1300 bicycles, users can check out bikes, ride around the city, and dock them back at any station.

**Age**: The system has been operational for 11 years.

**Funding**: Expansion is primarily funded by the government. However, there's no subsidy for operational costs, leading to challenges in maintaining the growing number of bikes and stations.

**Revenue**: As new stations are added in less trafficked areas, revenue per station has decreased.

### **Challenges**:
**Operational Costs**: While the government funds expansion, it doesn't subsidize operational costs.

**Station Imbalance**: Some stations frequently run out of bikes, while others get too full. This imbalance leads to lost revenue opportunities and increased operational challenges.

### **Solutions**:
**Operational Efficiency**:
Analyze data to improve efficiency within the organization.
Maintain a bike-to-dock ratio of 50/70 to ensure stations neither run out of bikes nor get too full.

Address challenges like relocating bikes and handling cases where users can't dock at their desired station.

**Increase Funding**:
Seek additional funds through philanthropy or increased government support.
Demonstrate the value of the BCycle network by showcasing its impact on the city and advocating its importance as a transportation option.
